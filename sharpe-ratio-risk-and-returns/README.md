# Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio
> Calculating risk and reward using Sharpe ratio in the stock market

When we assess whether to invest in an asset, we want to look not only at how much money
we could make but also at how much risk we are taking. 
The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago, 
does precisely this: it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative 
and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the 
standard deviation of returns.

In this project, we will apply the Sharpe ratio to real financial data using pandas.
